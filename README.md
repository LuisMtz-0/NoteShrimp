# NoteShrimp 

## Description

This program will deploy a website that will keep track of the users notes by using a local host and a database to store the information provided by the user.
Every time an individual adds a title and the note for each individual that note will then be stored inside the database to store it.
This was a great project to that helps dab into express and host all my future projects on the local host
